### **What is it?**
Front-end web developers address the visual/design elements and interactable portion of websites/web applications ("client-side"). This is done using various langauges such as HTML, CSS, Javascript etc. They form the link between design in the user interface (UI) and the back-end systems.

### **What Education is Required?**
> NOTE: There are many pathways to web development. Though many jobs descriptions may demand for the following, it is not always required. According to _Stack Overflow_, almost 70% of all developers are at least partially self-taught, with even 13% saying they are exclusively self-taught.

In web development, there are few specific degrees, however it is traditionally coupled with a bachelor in computer science. The key to success is commitment to ongoing learning to stay on top of fast moving changes/updates to languages, tool and trends. 

***
1) Associate in web development (two year program, focusing on getting students in and out, can get entry level postions)
2) Bachelor in computer science (traditional path, at least four years)
3) Master’s in web development (most take two years, complete a bachelor’s degree first)
4) Web development concentrations (choose a focus within web development, e.g. full-stack, web design, web programming, helpful if you want to pursue a particular niche in web development)
5) Web development bootcamps (intensive, accelerated path, around 14 weeks, still cost a tuition)
6) Web development certifications (demonstrate your competence in a particular skills and you meet industry standards, e.g. Google Developers Certification)
Increasing worthwhile investment, employers are increasingly dependent
