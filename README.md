In web development, there are few specific degrees, however it is traditionally coupled with a bachelor in computer science. The key to success is commitment to ongoing learning to stay on top of fast moving changes/updates to languages, tool and trends. 

A few possible paths in education are outlined below:

1) Associate in web development
    * two year program
    * entry level positions
    * focused on getting students in and out
2) Bachelor in computer science
    * four year minimum
    * "traditional" path
3) Master’s in web development 
    * most take approximately two years
    * requires a bachelor’s degree
4) Web development concentrations
    * choose a focus within web development (e.g. full-stack, web design, web programming) 
    * helpful if you want to pursue a particular niche in web development
5) Web development bootcamps
    * intensive, accelerated path
    * approximately 14 weeks
    * tuition still required
6) Web development certifications
    * demonstrate your competence in a particular skills and that you meet industry standards
