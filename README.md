# **_FRONT-END WEB DEVELOPER_**
## **What is it?**
Front-end web developers address the visual/design elements and interactable portion of websites/web applications ("client-side"). This is done using various langauges such as HTML, CSS, Javascript etc. They form the link between design in the user interface (UI) and the back-end systems. 

### IMAGE

### Responsibilities:
* Structure websites that can be easily found through a search engine (SEO = search engine optimization)
* Test sites and continuously fix bugs/other issues
* Anticipate user needs and behaviour 
* NOT web design (transform design into code that a web browser can read and display)
* work closely with graphic designers, back-end developers, project managers, quality assurance (QA) testers 
* create responsive design: sites that work and look good on different devices

## **THE PATH TO SUCCESS...**
### **What Education is Required?**
> NOTE: There are many pathways to web development. Though many jobs descriptions may demand for the following, it is not always required. According to _Stack Overflow_, almost 70% of all developers are at least partially self-taught, with even 13% saying they are exclusively self-taught. 

### IMAGE

In web development, there are few specific degrees, however it is traditionally coupled with a bachelor in computer science. The key to success is commitment to ongoing learning to stay on top of fast moving changes/updates to languages, tool and trends. 

A few possible paths in education are outlined below:

1) Associate in web development
    * two year program
    * entry level positions
    * focused on getting students in and out
2) Bachelor in computer science
    * four year minimum
    * "traditional" path
3) Master’s in web development 
    * most take approximately two years
    * requires a bachelor’s degree
4) Web development concentrations
    * choose a focus within web development (e.g. full-stack, web design, web programming) 
    * helpful if you want to pursue a particular niche in web development
5) Web development bootcamps
    * intensive, accelerated path
    * approximately 14 weeks
    * tuition still required
6) Web development certifications
    * demonstrate your competence in a particular skills and that you meet industry standards
    * e.g. Google Developers Certification
    * increasingly worthwhile investment, employers are becoming more dependent

### **What Technical and Non-Technical Skills do I need?**

> NOTE: To help form the connection with the back-end side of development, it may be helpful to also become familiar with backend associated langauges. (e.g. Python, PHP, Ruby etc.)

| *Technical* Skill     | Description                                                             
| :--------------------:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------
| HTML, CSS, Javascript | *HyperText Markup Language, Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript*, the foundation of front-end web development                                 
| DOM Manipulation      | *Document object model*, a programming interface representing the structure and content of any document on the web. This is useful for building interactive websites where users can store information or direct their own experience. (reflecting user preferences and needs)                                                                            
| JSON                  | *JavaScript Object Notation*, a data format providing a text-based representation of web data. This is essential for any site where information needs to be transferred between users and on the website's back-end
| React                 | A JavaScript library that enables front-end developers to build user interfaces. This is used to describe/declare how they wish the DOM to be changed and how the UI appears. React is particularly useful for developing applications that function like a desktop program.
| Angular               | One of this framework's main goals is to build single-page apps (SPAs). It provides a standard for members in a team to work with, as well as ease in creating large applications that are easy to manage. 
| Swift                 | Swift is used to create iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS applications. Frameworks and other third-party tools can easily be integrated with its built-in features and libraries.

#### **Non-Technical Skills**

1) Communication 
    * Frequent relay of information between UI/UX designers, front-end + back-end *needs* to be smooth to complete a project

2) Teamwork
    * Similar to the previous point, working with others is a daily occurance. Even as a freelance developer, you must work well with clients.

3) Willingness to learn 
    * As a dynamic industry, developers must keep designs up to date, requiring an open mind.
